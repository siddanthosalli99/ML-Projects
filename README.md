# ML-Projects

repo for my ML projects

Applied Machine Learning Projects (First Year)
Welcome! This repository contains all 8 of my end-to-end machine learning projects that I completed after my first year at IIIT during the summer break. These projects cover both supervised and unsupervised learning using real-world datasets from Kaggle, and are focused on solidifying my understanding of core ML concepts.

Summary
âœ… Supervised Learning
â€¢ 3 Classification Projects
â€¢ 3 Regression Projects

âœ… Unsupervised Learning
â€¢ 2 Clustering Projects

Each project involves proper data preprocessing, handling of missing values, outlier detection, scaling, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. I also experimented with hyperparameter tuning using Optuna, and visualized performance using clean plots.

Techniques Used :
Handling missing values, encoding, outliers, scaling
Feature Engineering
Model Evaluation Metrics
Hyperparameter Tuning (Optuna)
Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn

Algorithms Covered :
Logistic Regression
Linear Regression
SVM
Decision Trees
Random Forest
XGBoost
DBSCAN

Tech Stack
Python â€¢ Pandas â€¢ NumPy â€¢ Scikit-learn â€¢ XGBoost â€¢ Matplotlib â€¢ Seaborn â€¢ Optuna
